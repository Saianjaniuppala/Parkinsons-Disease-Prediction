# Parkinsons-Disease-Prediction
Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Symptoms
start gradually, sometimes with a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand. Tremors are
common, but the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement. Early
diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is crucial for managing the disease and improving the quality of
life for patients. Predicting the likelihood of Parkinson's disease using machine learning can help
in early diagnosis and treatment planning.
